# Login Issue - Fixed

## Problem
Users could create accounts successfully in Supabase, but after signing in, they stayed stuck on the login page instead of being redirected to the home page.

## Root Cause
When users signed in via the Supabase client on the frontend, the session was created in Supabase, but the user wasn't being synced to the database. When the frontend tried to fetch user data from `/api/auth?action=user`, it received a 404 error because the user didn't exist in the database, causing `isAuthenticated` to remain false and preventing the redirect.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Fix (api/auth.ts)
Modified the `/api/auth?action=user` endpoint to automatically sync users from Supabase to the database when they don't exist:

```typescript
// If user doesn't exist in database, sync them from Supabase
if (!dbUser) {
  const isAdmin = ADMIN_EMAILS.includes(supabaseUser.email || '');
  
  await db.insert(schema.users)
    .values({
      id: supabaseUser.id,
      email: supabaseUser.email || '',
      firstName: supabaseUser.user_metadata?.first_name || supabaseUser.email?.split('@')[0] || '',
      lastName: supabaseUser.user_metadata?.last_name || '',
      profileImageUrl: supabaseUser.user_metadata?.avatar_url || '',
      walletBalance: 0,
      isAdmin: isAdmin,
    })
    .onConflictDoUpdate({
      target: schema.users.id,
      set: {
        email: supabaseUser.email || '',
        firstName: supabaseUser.user_metadata?.first_name || supabaseUser.email?.split('@')[0] || '',
        lastName: supabaseUser.user_metadata?.last_name || '',
        profileImageUrl: supabaseUser.user_metadata?.avatar_url || '',
      }
    });

  // Fetch the newly created user
  dbUser = await db.query.users.findFirst({
    where: (users, { eq }) => eq(users.id, supabaseUser.id)
  });
}
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging
Added console logs to track the authentication flow:
- Sign-in process logs
- Session retrieval logs
- User data fetch logs

## Deployment Steps for Vercel

1. **Ensure latest code is committed**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Auto-sync users from Supabase on login"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Click on your project
   - Click "Redeploy" or trigger a new deployment
   - Wait for deployment to complete

3. **Test the login flow**:
   - Go to your Vercel URL
   - Sign in with credentials
   - Should automatically redirect to home page

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Before**: User signs in → Supabase creates session → Frontend fetches `/api/auth?action=user` → Backend can't find user → Returns 404 → `isAuthenticated = false` → Stuck on login page

2. **After**: User signs in → Supabase creates session → Frontend fetches `/api/auth?action=user` → Backend auto-syncs user from Supabase → Returns user data → `isAuthenticated = true` → Redirects to home page

## Admin Login Works Because
Admin accounts were likely created through the backend API (signup endpoint) which already syncs users to the database. Regular users who signed up through the frontend client only got created in Supabase, not in the database.
